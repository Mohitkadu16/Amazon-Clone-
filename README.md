Hello, My name is Mohit kadu. I am student of Vidyalankar Polytechnic and doing Diploma in Electronics and telecommunication.

So, in this I have tried to clone Amazon global website (amazon.com) for first time in my life.

And it is for my backup I am saving my code on GitHub.

I know this is not a great thing or not an impossible thing, but for me and for my stream i am in, it is vary different.
